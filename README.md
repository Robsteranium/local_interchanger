#Local Interchanger

##Intro
This is a rails app that facilitates trade in a Local Exchange Trading System.
It's pretty alpha at the minute!

##Installation
You'll need a Rails3 stack.  At the moment its using sqlite for storage (mostly because it's still in the early stages of development).  You can read the rest of the requirements in the Gemfile
